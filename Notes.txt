########## Mental Notes ##########
-- I'm thinking about creating a cms closely replicating OpenCities, except way better functionality
---- Database Models ----
-- Have the option to integrate ldap, or use django auth
-- Will new pages have their own db tables or would django create the content behind the scenes and add it to the apps?
-- workflows
-- administration
-- templates
-- roles (granularity)

---- Project/App Content ----
-- a bundle of templates which the users can choose from (will be wrapped into a base.html) (perhaps bootstrap themed)
-- will the urls be created and added to the app urls file or added to the database
